  ## Loading tabular data
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Loading tabular data
```

One the most common ways of getting data into R is to read in a table. And -- you guessed it -- we read it into a data frame! We will take a simple CSV file as example. [What is a CSV file?](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/What-is-a-CSV-file-and-how-do-I-save-my-spreadsheet-as-one)

You may know about [the Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu) and we will be working with a sample dataset from their repository (https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/). The sample I extracted contains information about traffic stops for black and white drivers in the state of Mississippi during January 2013 to mid-July of 2016. 

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file
that contains the traffic stop data, and we will use `read.csv()` to
load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`.

To download the data into your local `data/` subdirectory, run the following:
  
  ```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
download.file("http://bit.ly/MS_trafficstops_bw", "data/MS_trafficstops_bw.csv")
```

You are now ready to load the data:
  
  ```{r, eval=TRUE,  purl=FALSE}
trafficstops <- read.csv("data/MS_trafficstops_bw.csv")
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because, as you might recall,
assignments don't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been
loaded, we can print the variable's value: `trafficstops`.

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded
properly. Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the
function `head()`:
  
  ```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
head(trafficstops)
```


## Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Inspecting `data.frame` Objects
```

As you may recall, a data frame in R is a special case of a list, and a representation of data where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because the columns are vectors, they all contain the same type of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors, etc.).

We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:
  
  ```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
str(trafficstops)
```


We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

* Size:
    * `dim(trafficstops)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
          and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
          the object)
    * `nrow(trafficstops)` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol(trafficstops)` - returns the number of columns
    * `length(trafficstops)` - returns number of columns

* Content:
    * `head(trafficstops)` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail(trafficstops)` - shows the last 6 rows
    
* Names:
    * `names(trafficstops)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	   objects)
    * `rownames(trafficstops)` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str(trafficstops)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
	   content of  each column
    * `summary(trafficstops)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.

## Indexing and subsetting data frames

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Indexing and subsetting data frames
```


Our trafficstops data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note
that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with
different classes.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
trafficstops[1, 1]   # first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
trafficstops[1, 6]   # first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
trafficstops[, 1]    # first column in the data frame (as a vector)
trafficstops[1]      # first column in the data frame (as a data.frame)
trafficstops[1:3, 7] # first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
trafficstops[3, ]    # the 3rd row (as a data.frame)
trafficstops[1:6, ]  # the 1st to 6th rows, equivalent to head(trafficstops)
trafficstops[, -1]           # the whole data frame, excluding the first column
trafficstops[-c(7:211211),]  # equivalent to head(trafficstops)
```

As well as using numeric values to subset a `data.frame` (or `matrix`), columns
can be called by name, using one of the four following notations:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
trafficstops["violation_raw"]       # Result is a data.frame
trafficstops[, "violation_raw"]     # Result is a vector
trafficstops[["violation_raw"]]     # Result is a vector
trafficstops$violation_raw          # Result is a vector
```

For our purposes, the last three notations are equivalent. RStudio knows about
the columns in your data frame, so you can take advantage of the autocompletion
feature to get the full and correct column name.

  ## Conditional subsetting 
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Conditional subsetting
```

Often times we need to extract a subset of a data frame based on certain conditions. For example, if we wanted to look at traffic stops in Webster County only we could say:
  
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
# the condition:
# returns a logical vector of the length of the column
trafficstops$county_name == "Webster County" 

# use this vector to extract rows and all columns
# note the comma: we want *all* columns
trafficstops[trafficstops$county_name == "Webster County", ] 

# assign extract to a new data frame
Webster_trafficstops <- trafficstops[trafficstops$county_name == "Webster County", ]
```

This is also a possibility (but slower):
  
  ```{r results='show'}
Webster_trafficstops <- subset(trafficstops, county_name == "Webster County")
nrow(Webster_trafficstops) # 393 stops in Webster County!

# and if we wanted to see the breakdown by race:
table(Webster_trafficstops$driver_race)
```

These commands are from the R base package. In the R Data Wrangling workshop we will discuss a different way of subsetting using functions from the `tidyverse` package.

  ## Adding and removing rows and columns
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Adding and removing rows and columns
```

To add a new column to the data frame we can use the `cbind()` function.

```{r, results='show'}
new_col <- row.names(trafficstops)
trafficstops_withnewcol <- cbind(trafficstops, new_col)
head(trafficstops_withnewcol)
```

Alternatively, we can also add a new column adding the new column name after the `$` sign then assigning the value, like below. Note that this will change the original data frame, which you may not always want to do.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trafficstops$row_numbers <- c(1:nrow(trafficstops))
trafficstops$all_false <- FALSE  # what do you think will happen here?
```


There is an equivalent function, `rbind()` to add a new row to a data frame. I use this far less frequently than the column equivalent. The one thing to keep in mind is that the row to be added to the data frame needs to match the order and type of columns in the data frame. Remember that R's way to store multiple different data types in one object is a `list`. So if we wanted to add a new row to `trafficstops` we would say:

```{r, results='show'}
new_row <- data.frame(id="MS-2017-12345", state="MS", stop_date="2017-08-24",
                county_name="Tallahatchie County", county_fips=12345,
                police_department="MSHP", driver_gender="F", driver_birthdate="1999-06-14",
                driver_race="Hispanic", violation_raw="Speeding", officer_id="ABCD")

trafficstops_withnewrow <- rbind(trafficstops, new_row)
tail(trafficstops_withnewrow)
```


A convenient function to know about is `na.omit()`. It will remove all rows from a data frame that have at least one column with `NA` values.

## Categorical data: factors

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Factors
```

Factors are very useful and are actually
something that make R particularly well suited to working with data, so we're
going to spend a little time introducing them.

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or
unordered, and understanding them is necessary for statistical analysis and for
plotting.

Factors are stored as integers, and have labels (text) associated with these
unique integers. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors,
they are actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when
treating them like strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts *levels* in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:
  
  ```{r, purl=TRUE}
party <- factor(c("republican", "democrat", "democrat", "republican"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"democrat"` and `2` to the level `"republican"` (because
                                                                                 `d` comes before `r`, even though the first element in this vector is
                                                                                 `"republican"`). You can check this by using the function `levels()`, and check the
number of levels using `nlevels()`:
  
  ```{r, purl=FALSE}
levels(party)
nlevels(party)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high"),
it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of
analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in the `party` vector would be:
  
  ```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
party # current order
party <- factor(party, levels = c("republican", "democrat"))
party # after re-ordering
```

In R's memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), but are more
informative than integers because factors are self describing: `"democrat"`,
`"republican"` is more descriptive than `1`, `2`. Which one is "republican"?  You wouldn't
be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, on the other hand, have
this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels
(like the county names in our example dataset).

### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
as.character(party)
as.factor(party)
```

Converting factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration
                                                       levels, or years) to a numeric vector is a little trickier.  One method is to
convert factors to characters and then numbers.  Another method is to use the
`levels()` function. Compare:
  
  ```{r, purl=TRUE}
f <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(f)               # wrong! and there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(f)) # works...
as.numeric(levels(f))[f]    # The recommended way.
```

Notice that in the `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:
  
  * We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(f)`
* We convert these levels to numeric values using `as.numeric(levels(f))`
* We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the vector `f`  as indices inside the square brackets

### Renaming factors

When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the `plot()` function to get a
quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor
level. Let's look at the number of blacks and whites in the dataset:

```{r driver-race-barplot, purl=TRUE}
# Coerce the column "driver_race" into a factor
trafficstops$driver_race <- factor(trafficstops$driver_race)
# bar plot of the number of black and white drivers stopped:
trafficstops$driver_race <- as.factor(trafficstops$driver_race)
plot(trafficstops$driver_race)
```

There seem to be a number of individuals for which the race information hasn't been recorded.

Additionally, for these individuals, there is no label to indicate that the information is missing. Let’s rename this label to something more meaningful. Before doing that, we’re going to pull out the data on race and work with that data, so we’re not modifying the working copy of the data frame:
  
  ```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
race <- trafficstops$driver_race
head(race)
levels(race)
levels(race)[1] <- "Missing"
levels(race)
head(race)
```

> <h3>Challenge</h3>
  >
  > * Rename "Black" to "African American".
> * Now that we have renamed the factor level to "Missing", can you recreate the
>  barplot such that "Missing" is last (to the right)?

## Challenges

## * Rename "Black" to "African American".
## * Now that we have renamed the factor level to "Missing", can you recreate the

## Answers

race <- factor(race, levels = c("African American", "White", "Missing"))

### Using `stringsAsFactors`
  
  As of R version 4.0.0, the stringsAsfactors argument defaults to FALSE when using `read.csv()`. 

Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these columns as `character` or set `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` to coerce strings to factors when importing csv files. Alternatively, the `read_csv()` function from the dplyr library also does not covert strings to factors (more on this another day). 


<<<<<<< HEAD
### Using `stringsAsFactors=TRUE`

By default, when building or importing a data frame with `read.csv()`, the columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are read as such. Depending on what you intend to do with the data, you may want to keep these
columns as `character` or convert to `factor`. To do so, `read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an
argument called `stringsAsFactors` which can be set to `TRUE`.

Compare the output of `str(trafficstops)` when setting `stringsAsFactors = TRUE`
 and `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` (default):


```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
=======
Compare the output of `str(trafficstops)` when setting `stringsAsFactors = TRUE`
(default) and `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`:

trafficstops <- read.csv("data/MS_policing_bw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(trafficstops)
trafficstops <- read.csv("data/MS_policing_bw.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(trafficstops) # this is now the default.

  The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes an
annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check that data
you import in R are of the correct type within your data frame. If not, use it
to your advantage to detect mistakes that might have been introduced during data
entry (a letter in a column that should only contain numbers for instance).


## Dates

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Dates
```
One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is converting
date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and usable during
analyses. If you have control over your data it might be useful to ensure that each component of your date is stored as a separate
variable, i.e a separate column for day, month, and year. However, often we do not have control and the date is stored in one single column and with varying order and separating characters between its components.

Using `str()`, we can see that both dates in our data frame `stop_date` and `driver_birthdate` are each stored in one column.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
str(trafficstops)
```

As an example for how to work with dates let us see if there are seasonal differences in the number of traffic stops.

We're going to be using the `ymd()` function from the package **`lubridate`**. This
function is designed to take a vector representing year, month, and day and convert
that information to a POSIXct vector. POSIXct is a class of data recognized by R as
being a date or date and time. The argument that the function requires is relatively
flexible, but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".

Start by loading the required package:

```{r load-package, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
```


```{r, purl=FALSE}
stop_date <- ymd(trafficstops$stop_date)
str(stop_date) # notice the 'date' class
```

The `ymd` function also has nicely taken care of the fact that the original format of the date column is a factor!

We can now easily extract year, month, and date using the respective functions: `year()`, `month()`, and `day()` like so:

```{r yearly-stops, purl=FALSE}
plot(factor(year(stop_date))) #convert year to factor to plot
```

```{r calculate-age-answer, purl=FALSE}
birth_date <- ymd(trafficstops$driver_birthdate)
age <- stop_date - birth_date
# or
age <- year(stop_date) - year(birth_date)
plot(factor(age)) # negative age
# or
hist(age)
